# Machine-Learning-Sentiment-Analysis
Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Training, Tweets.

 
Notes: 

- need to add try and catch blocks for error handling if any errors occur.
- Adding attention layer for new results and modifiying attention layer.
- Using Gru layers and standard LSTM layers.
- changing exponential learning decay rates for further analysis and   Learning Rate schedules, will further accomadate for over fitting and under fitting and majority biases.

- improved model performance via optimisation of shuffling and using 20% of the dataset, also additional hyper parameter tuning.

Requires:
- minimum 15gb ram (16 gb of ram preferable) could try reducing hidden units and Initial learning rate so less learnables being used so less ram required however will affect result accuracy.
